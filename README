By far the most fun. Code provided in sploit6.py.

I fill up the write buffer to cause the program to block on an fprintf right before it forks.
I then check to see if the echo process managed to print. If it did I rule out the character.

It took a while when the box was loaded (fork bombed) to get the whole thing. I would sometimes have to restart
it with whatever it managed to figure out.
